I developed the Ignite Timer project, where you can create a project with time and start the timer, being able to interrupt it, there will also be a history tab where you can see the times that were completed, interrupted or in progress.

## 👏 Learning and more implementations

- Implemented and learned Sytles Components for CSS.
- Implemented and learned about React Router Rom, where Home and Historical routes were created.
- In the form used the React Hook Form and for the validation the zod.
- For date comparison and formatting, we use the date-fns library.
- In this project, a Context was created so that the pages can access the methods.
- A cycle reducer was also created, to share the logic in one place.
- I used the Immer library to make it easy to change the reducer mutation.
- Used the local Storage to store the data and recovery.
